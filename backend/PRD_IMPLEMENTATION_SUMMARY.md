  - Business information including funding details and user scale
  - Development team information with multilingual support
  - Status tracking and tagging system
  - Related agents functionality
  - Metrics and timeline tracking

### 2. Database Integration

- **Implemented MongoDB integration** as specified in the PRD:
  - Added MongoDB connection management
  - Created proper indexing strategies for performance
  - Implemented collection management for agents and favorites

### 3. API Enhancement

- **Added PRD-compliant API endpoints**:
  - Advanced search and filtering capabilities
  - Multilingual support in API responses
  - Business information endpoints
  - Technical stack filtering
  - Related agents recommendation system
  - Favorite/收藏 functionality

### 4. Data Validation and Quality

- **Implemented comprehensive data validation**:
  - URL format and accessibility checking
  - Technical stack validation against predefined lists
  - Business information validation
  - Data quality scoring system
  - Input sanitization and security measures

### 5. New Features Implementation

- **Favorite/收藏 functionality**:
  - User-specific agent bookmarking
  - Favorite management API endpoints
  - MongoDB storage for favorites

- **Related Agents Recommendation**:
  - Algorithm based on shared tags and technical stack
  - API endpoint for fetching related agents

- **Sample Data Population**:
  - Scripts for initializing database with sample agents
  - Realistic sample data for ChatGPT and Claude

## Key Files Created

### Backend Files
- `src/agentpedia/models/mongodb_models.py` - MongoDB data models
- `src/agentpedia/models/favorite.py` - Favorite data models
- `src/agentpedia/core/mongodb.py` - MongoDB connection management
- `src/agentpedia/schemas/agent_prd.py` - PRD-compliant schemas
- `src/agentpedia/api/v1/agents_prd.py` - PRD-compliant API endpoints
- `src/agentpedia/api/v1/favorites.py` - Favorite API endpoints
- `src/agentpedia/services/mongodb_agent_service.py` - MongoDB agent service
- `src/agentpedia/services/favorite_service.py` - Favorite management service
- `src/agentpedia/services/validation_service.py` - Data validation service
- `src/agentpedia/scripts/sample_data.py` - Sample data generation

## Configuration Updates

- Added MongoDB configuration options to `config.py`
- Updated requirements.txt with MongoDB driver
- Updated API router to include new endpoints
- Updated main application to initialize MongoDB services

## Documentation

- Updated README with new scripts and usage instructions
- Created this implementation summary

## Remaining Task

The only remaining task is to refactor the frontend to use Next.js App Router as specified in the PRD. This would involve:

1. Converting the React application to Next.js
2. Implementing the internationalization system
3. Adding Dark Mode support
4. Creating the page structure as specified in the PRD
5. Implementing all the UI components with the specified design system

## Testing

The implementation includes error handling, logging, and validation to ensure data quality and system reliability. The MongoDB integration provides the flexibility needed for the semi-structured data described in the PRD.
